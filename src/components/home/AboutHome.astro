      Why Families Choose Hospice and Palliative Care of California
    </h2>

    <p class="text-grey text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We provide hospice care that honors the needs, values, and preferences of each individual and their family. Our team takes time to understand the person beyond the illness by learning daily rhythms, sources of comfort, and what brings a sense of calm, so care feels personal, respectful, and supportive. We listen closely, work in collaboration with families and physicians, and shape care around the details that help create steadiness and reassurance during this time.
      <br><br>
      Support is always available. Our hospice team offers 24/7 on-call support for questions, concerns, or urgent needs, while in-home visits are thoughtfully scheduled based on the individual’s care plan and evolving needs. Through clear communication and consistent coordination, we remain a steady source of support, ensuring care is always within reach.
